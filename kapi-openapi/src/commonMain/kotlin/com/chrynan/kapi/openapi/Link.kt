/**
 * The Link object represents a possible design-time link for a response. The presence of a link does not guarantee the
 * callerâ€™s ability to successfully invoke it, rather it provides a known relationship and traversal mechanism between
 * responses and other operations.
 *
 * Unlike dynamic links (i.e. links provided in the response payload), the OAS linking mechanism does not require link
 * information in the runtime response.
 *
 * For computing links, and providing instructions to execute them, a
 * [runtime expression](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0#runtimeExpression) is used for accessing values in an
 * operation and using them as parameters while invoking the linked operation.
 *
 * This object MAY be extended with
 * [Specification Extensions](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0#specificationExtensions).
 *
 * A linked operation MUST be identified using either an operationRef or operationId. In the case of an operationId, it
 * MUST be unique and resolved in the scope of the OAS document. Because of the potential for name clashes, the
 * operationRef syntax is preferred for OpenAPI documents with external references.
 *
 * @property [operationRef] A relative or absolute URI reference to an OAS operation. This field is mutually exclusive
 * of the operationId field, and MUST point to an Operation Object. Relative operationRef values MAY be used to locate
 * an existing Operation Object in the OpenAPI definition. See the rules for resolving Relative References.
 * @property [operationId] The name of an existing, resolvable OAS operation, as defined with a unique operationId.
 * This field is mutually exclusive of the operationRef field.
 * @property [parameters] A map representing parameters to pass to an operation as specified with operationId or
 * identified via operationRef. The key is the parameter name to be used, whereas the value can be a constant or an
 * expression to be evaluated and passed to the linked operation. The parameter name can be qualified using the
 * parameter location [{in}.]{name} for operations that use the same parameter name in different locations
 * (e.g. path.id).
 * @property [requestBody] A literal value or {expression} to use as a request body when calling the target operation.
 * @property [description] A description of the link. [CommonMark syntax](https://spec.commonmark.org/) MAY be used for
 * rich text representation.
 * @property [server] A server object to be used by the target operation.
 *
 * @see [OpenApi Specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0#link-object)
