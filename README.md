![Build](https://github.com/chRyNaN/kapi/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

```kotlin
@Api
interface IdentityApi {

    @GET("/user/{id}")
    suspend fun getUser(@Path id: String): User
}

fun Application.module() {
    routing {
        // Function is auto-generated. Provide an `IdentityApi` instance.
        registerIdentityApi(api = IdentityApiImpl())
    }
}
```

## Status ‚ö†Ô∏è

This project is in an early stage and under active development. Breaking changes may occur between released versions.

## Getting Started üèÅ

First, set up the [KSP](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/ksp-quickstart.html) plugin. The following can be added to the
module's `build.gradle.kts` file to add the KSP plugin:

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.google.devtools.ksp") version "1.8.10-1.0.9"
}
```

Then, add the repositories for this project:

```kotlin
repositories {
    maven { url = uri("https://repo.repsy.io/mvn/chrynan/public") }
}
```

Finally, add the dependencies of this project:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    // The annotation processor - see ksp documentation for multiplatform builds
    ksp("com.chrynan.kapi:kapi-server-ksp:$kapiVersion")

    // The runtime library
    implementation("com.chrynan.kapi:kapi-server-core:$kapiVersion")
}
```

**Note:** It may be required
to [add the generated sources](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/ksp-quickstart.html#make-ide-aware-of-generated-code) of the
KSP processor for the IDE to recognize the generated code and resources. The following is an example of adding the
generated sources for a Kotlin JVM project:

```kotlin
kotlin {
    sourceSets.main {
        kotlin.srcDir("build/generated/ksp/main/kotlin")
        resources.srcDir("build/generated/ksp/main/resources/")
    }
}
```

## Defining an API üßë‚Äçüíª

An API component can be a Kotlin interface, class, or object. Just annotate the API component with the `@Api` annotation
for the processor to register the component. The `@Api` annotation contains properties that can be provided that are
useful to the processor when it generates the Ktor bindings and Open API Spec files.

```kotlin
@Api(
    name = "IdentityApi",
    basePath = "/identity",
    info = Info(
        title = "Identity Service API",
        summary = "Provides API functions for accessing and updating user identities."
    )
)
interface IdentityApiComponent {}
```
