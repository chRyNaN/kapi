## Status ‚ö†Ô∏è

This project is in an early stage and under active development. Breaking changes may occur between released versions.
Until the version is a release version of `1.0.0` or greater, this project is considered to be in an experimental state.

## Getting Started üèÅ

First, set up the [KSP](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/ksp-quickstart.html) plugin. The following can be added to the
module's `build.gradle.kts` file to add the KSP plugin:

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.google.devtools.ksp") version "1.8.10-1.0.9"
}
```

Then, add the repositories for this project:

```kotlin
repositories {
    maven { url = uri("https://repo.repsy.io/mvn/chrynan/public") }
}
```

Finally, add the dependencies of this project:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    // The annotation processor - see ksp documentation for multiplatform builds
    ksp("com.chrynan.kapi:kapi-server-ksp:$kapiVersion")

    // The runtime library
    implementation("com.chrynan.kapi:kapi-server-core:$kapiVersion")
}
```

**Note:** It may be required
to [add the generated sources](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/ksp-quickstart.html#make-ide-aware-of-generated-code) of the
KSP processor for the IDE to recognize the generated code and resources. The following is an example of adding the
generated sources for a Kotlin JVM project:

```kotlin
kotlin {
    sourceSets.main {
        kotlin.srcDir("build/generated/ksp/main/kotlin")
        resources.srcDir("build/generated/ksp/main/resources/")
    }
}
```

### Configuration

It possible to configure the kapi server KSP plugin
by [providing KSP options](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/ksp-quickstart.html#pass-options-to-processors) in the
`build.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
ksp {
    arg("kapi.config.jsonProcessorConfig.enabled", "true")
}
```

#### Available KSP configurations

* `kapi.config.jsonProcessorConfig.enabled` - Enable/disable the generation of the `apis.json` file containing all the
  information about the processed APIs. Defaults to `true`.
* `kapi.config.ktorProcessorConfig.enabled` - Enable/disable the generation of Ktor bindings. Defaults to `true`.
* `kapi.config.openApiProcessorConfig.enabled` - Enabled/disable the generation of Open API Specification files.
  Defaults to `true`.

## Defining an API üßë‚Äçüíª

### API components

An API component can be a Kotlin interface, class, or object. Just annotate the API component with the `@Api` annotation
for the processor to register the component. The `@Api` annotation contains properties that can be provided that are
useful to the processor when it generates the Ktor bindings and Open API Spec files.

```kotlin
@Api(
    name = "IdentityApi",
    basePath = "/identity",
    info = Info(
        title = "Identity Service API",
        summary = "Provides API functions for accessing and updating user identities."
    )
)
interface IdentityApiComponent {}
```

### API functions

API functions are normal Kotlin functions of the API component that are annotated with an HTTP method annotation. These
functions correspond to HTTP methods at the specified path. For example, the following function, of the
`IdentityApiComponent` created above, will create an HTTP GET endpoint at `/identity/{id}`:

```kotlin
@GET("/{id}")
suspend fun getIdentity(@Path id: String): Identity
```

#### Supported HTTP Methods

* `@GET`
* `@POST`
* `@PUT`
* `@PATCH`
* `@DELETE`
* `@HEAD`
* `@OPTIONS`

An API function can only be annotated with one of the above supported HTTP method annotations. Each of the HTTP method
annotations has a required `path` property. A function in an API component that is not annotated with a supported HTTP
method annotation is not considered an API function and no endpoint binding will be created for it.

#### Parameters

Parameters of an API function must either be annotated with a supported parameter annotation, have a default value, or
be a supported type that can be provided by the generated code.

##### Supported Parameter Annotations

* `@Body` - Represents the HTTP request body.
* `@Field` - Represents a field from the HTTP request body when the content type is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
* `@Header` - Represents an HTTP header extracted from the request.
* `@Part` - Represents a part of the HTTP request body when the content type is `multipart/form-data`.
* `@Path` - Represents a path parameter extracted from the URL of the request.
* `@Query` - Represents a query parameter extracted from the URL of the request.
* `@Principal` - Represents an auth principal obtained from the request.

##### Supported Types

API function parameters that are not annotated with the above annotations must either have a default value or be one of
the following types:

* `kotlin.Unit`
* `io.ktor.server.application.ApplicationCall`
* `io.ktor.server.routing.Route`

#### Extension Receivers

API functions may be extension functions of the following types:

* `io.ktor.server.application.ApplicationCall`
* `io.ktor.server.routing.Route`

This provides a way of accessing the underlying Ktor components for the endpoints for advanced use-cases.

#### Return Types

The value returned from an API function is the HTTP response of the endpoint. The content type of the HTTP response is
determined by the Ktor content negotiation plugin that must be set up separately from this library. Any type that works
with the Ktor content negotiation plugin can be returned from an API function. However, special handling is performed
for the `com.chrynan.kapi.core.Response` type, which will result in the `Response.body()` value being the HTTP response
of the endpoint.

#### Accepted Content Types

The kapi library provides a way to establish the accepted content types for a particular API function. This can be done
by annotating an API function with `@Consumes` (or an annotation whose class itself is annotated with `@Consumes`). An
API function can only support accepting a single specified content type, or any content type that is supported by the
Ktor content negotiation plugin that is set up. Here are some examples:

* `@Consumes("application/json")` - Accepts an HTTP request body with a content type of `application/json`.
* `@Consumes("*/*")` - Accepts any content type for the HTTP request body.
* `@Consumes("")` - Accepts any content type supported by the established Ktor content negotiation plugin.
* `@ContentNegotiation` - Same as the `@Consumes("")` usage - Accepts any content type supported by the established Ktor
  content negotiation plugin.
* `@ApplicationJson` - Accepts an HTTP request body with a content type of `application/json`.
* `@ApplicationFormUrlEncoded` - Accepts an HTTP request body with a content type
  of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
* `@MultipartFormData` - Accepts an HTTP request body with a content type of `multipart/form-data`.

You can also create your own content type annotation like this:

```kotlin
@Consumes(contentType = "text/*")
@Target(AnnotationTarget.FUNCTION)
annotation class TextAny
```

If an API function is set up to accept a particular content type that is not a blank String or any value ("*/*"),
then this will result in the generated Ktor endpoint being wrapped in an `accept(contentType) { ... }` function call.

#### Status Codes and Error Handling

An API function can be annotated with the `@Produces` annotation to indicate the success and error responses that the
function can return. For instance, the following function will respond with an `Identity` model and a status code
of `200` for a successful response when the function returns without an exception being thrown:

```kotlin
@GET("/{id}")
@Produces(
    success = Success(
        statusCode = 200
    )
)
suspend fun getIdentity(@Path id: String): Identity
```

When an API function throws an exception, that exception can be caught and result in an `ApiError` model (which is a
rough implementation of the [RFC-7807 specification](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7807)) being the HTTP response of
the API endpoint, for example:

```kotlin
@GET("/{id}")
@Produces(
    success = Success(
        statusCode = 200
    ),
    errors = [
        Error(
            statusCode = 500,
            exception = IllegalStateException::class,
            title = "Internal Server Error"
        )
    ]
)
suspend fun getIdentity(@Path id: String): Identity
```

In the above example, if the `getIdentity` API function throws an `IllegalStateException`, that will result in an HTTP
response of type `ApiError` with a status code of `500`.

### Authentication and Authorization

Authentication and authorization for APIs is handled through the concept of "SecuritySchemes", "SecurityRequirements",
and the `@Auth` annotation. First, you must establish the Security Schemes for an API by adding them to the `@Api`
annotation:

```kotlin
@Api(
    securitySchemes = [
        SecurityScheme(
            SecurityScheme(
                name = "OAuthToken",
                type = SecurityScheme.Type.OAUTH2,
                flows = [
                    OAuthFlow(
                        type = OAuthFlow.Type.AUTHORIZATION_CODE,
                        authorizationUrl = "https://auth.example.com",
                        scopes = [
                            OAuthScope("read"),
                            OAuthScope("write")
                        ]
                    )
                ]
            )
        )
    ]
)
interface IdentityApiComponent { ... }
```

Then, create a convenience annotation for applying a Security Requirement for an API component that points to the above
created Security Scheme:

```kotlin
@Auth(
    SecurityRequirement(name = "OAuthToken", scopes = ["read"]),
    type = Auth.RequirementType.ALL
)
@Target(AnnotationTarget.CLASS, AnnotationTarget.FUNCTION)
annotation class RequiresReadAccess
```

Finally, apply the annotation to any API components that require that scope to access:

```kotlin
@GET("/{id}")
@RequiresReadAccess
suspend fun getIdentity(@Path id: String): Identity
```

**Note:** To obtain the [Principal](https://ktor.io/docs/authentication.html#configure-provider) from the result of
successful authentication, use the `@Principal` annotation on a parameter of an API function.

#### Authentication

While OAuth scope-based Authorization is handled automatically within the generated code, the Authentication providers
still have to be [established manually](https://ktor.io/docs/authentication.html). However, there is a convenience
extension property automatically generated on the `KapiSecurity` model that can be used to gain access to all of an
APIs `SecurityDefinitions`:

```kotlin
install(Authentication) {
    Kapi.security.exampleApi.definitions.forEach { definition ->
        definition.provider // String name value equivalent to the `@SecurityScheme.name` property value.
        definition.scheme // Open API `SecurityScheme` model instance.
    }
}
```

### Registering an API

To register an API with Ktor, just invoke the generated `Route` extension function providing the API implementation:

```kotlin
routing {
    registerIdentityApi(api = IdentityApiImpl())
}
```

## Inspiration üí°

This project was inspired by the works of the following open source projects and libraries:

* [retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit)
* [ktor](https://github.com/ktorio/ktor)
* [Ktorfit](https://github.com/Foso/Ktorfit)
* [ktor-retrofit](https://github.com/bnorm/ktor-retrofit)
* [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/)
* [JAX-RS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_RESTful_Web_Services)

## Motivation üß†

This project arose from my desire to create server-side APIs in a reusable, compile-time safe, and Kotlin multiplatform
friendly manner while still utilizing modern frameworks, such as Ktor. I didn't want to fiddle around with creating
large JSON or YAML Open API files after already creating the Kotlin API endpoints just so client-side code can utilize
my API. Also, I wanted to be able to write my APIs in Kotlin where each endpoint is a Kotlin function whose parameters
are extracted from the HTTP request and whose return value is the HTTP response body. So, I created this library with
the hope of providing a tool for anyone with similar desires for their APIs. The following can be considered benefits of
utilizing this library over directly writing your server APIs in Ktor:

* The APIs can be written in Kotlin, just as you would write any other Kotlin function. This should expedite the API
  development as it no longer requires getting familiar with complex framework components.
* Reusable interfaces with HTTP endpoint metadata. This allows separation from the HTTP concepts from the implementation
  of the code itself. The interface function can contain all the annotation metadata about the HTTP and API concepts,
  while the implementations can simply be focused on performing the business logic.
* Auto-generation and hosting of Open API JSON files, so you don't have to fiddle with creating those files manually.
